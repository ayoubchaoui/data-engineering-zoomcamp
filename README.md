# Data Engineering Zoomcamp Project ðŸš€  

This repository contains my implementation of the **Data Engineering Zoomcamp** project. It includes exercises and projects related to **Docker**, **Postgres**, and **Terraform**, leveraging modern data engineering tools and cloud technologies.  


---

## Introduction  
This project is part of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp), a hands-on learning experience designed to build strong foundational skills in data engineering.  

The main topics covered include:  
1. Dockerizing an ingestion pipeline.  
2. Managing infrastructure with **Terraform** on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
3. Running PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and Docker Compose.  

---

## Technologies  
The following technologies are used in this project:  
- **Docker**: Containerization of applications and pipelines.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for ingesting and managing datasets.  
- **pgAdmin**: PostgreSQL management tool.  
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning resources in GCP.  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Cloud environment to host data pipelines.

## Features  
1. Ingested NYC taxi data into PostgreSQL using Docker.  
2. Automated infrastructure provisioning on GCP with Terraform.  
3. Hands-on practice with Docker Compose and containerized pipelines.
